            <p>

                To access and use the Platform, Users will need to employ a browser that is compatible with the acquisition of an Ethereum Wallet, for example, but not limited to Google Chrome and MetaMask.  Once you have installed a browser such as Chrome, you will need to create an electronic wallet with MetaMask, or another provider, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using the native Ethereum cryptocurrency, ETH. The Platform will only recognize you as a User, and you will only be able to interact with the Platform, if your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask, or other account. There is no other way to sign up as a User, or to interact directly with the Platform.

            <h3>Transactions on the MixDAO Platform are public knowledge.</h3>
            <p>
                Transactions that take place on the Platform are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. The User understands that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Platform.  MixDAO neither owns nor controls MetaMask, or any other Ethereum wallet provider, Google Chrome, or any other browser, the Ethereum network, or any other third-party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the Platform. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.

            </p>
            <h3>MixDAO is not a custodian of items obtained by affiliates.</h3>
            <p>

            <h3>The MixDAO Platform</h3>
            <p>
            <h3>Alpha Pass</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                Alpha Pass is an NFT minted from our smart contract in exchange for Ether purchased by users on the MixDAO Platform.
            </p>
            <h3>How the Token Works</h3>
            <p>
                The "Alpha Pass" NFT is an ERC-1155 token with a supply of 1500 tokens and a price of 0.08 ETH.  A small subset of early supporters is entitled to a free claim of 1 NFT (the list of which has already been determined by wallet address and filtered by our smart contract).
            </p>
            <h3>Allowlist (Also known as a whitelist)</h3>
            <p>
                 MixDAO has also created an allowlist, which is a list available to early supporters, and spots for our collaborators, and other teams and projects that we are working with, and people that have been actively engaged in our public discord.  The allowlist is determined by MixDAO in its sole discretion, and anyone can be added to or removed from the list at our sole discretion.  Members of the allowlist will have access to minting on April 17th, and the public sale will be on April 18th.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Alpha Pass</h3>
            <p>
                Except with respect to Allowlist designates as described above, the "Alpha Pass" NFT will grant users access to an exclusive role and channel in our discord.  Only holders of this NFT will be allowed into the channel, and it will be gated by the token.  The Alpha Pass acts as a membership card and will give the user special privileges including but not limited to being added to the allowlist for all future MixDAO projects, access to in-person events should we hold them, raffles, allowlist opportunities for partner projects, 1 free claim for our upcoming Season 1 NFT drop which is TBD.
            </p>
            <h3>Discord</h3>
            <p>
                Our customer service and general community will be on discord at: <a href="https://discord.gg/mixdao">https://discord.gg/mixdao</a>. If users have any issues or problems, they can open up a ticket in the support channel and we will respond to them.  The discord itself is public and anyone can join; however - only Alpha Pass holders will get access to the exclusive "Alpha Pass" channels and role.
            </p>
            <h3>MixDAO Platform and Fees</h3>
            <p>
                Every transaction on the MixDAO Platform is subject to Fees collected to support the creators, MixDAO Platform and MIX DAO LLC.
                <br>
                The amount of Fees for the sale of a MixDAO Item also depends on whether the transaction involves the MixDAO Item’s first sale (“Primary Sale”) or a subsequent sale in the secondary market (“Secondary Market Sale”).  All Fees are collected and distributed at the time of the purchase of a MixDAO Item by operation of the Smart Contracts.
            </p>
            <h3>Fees Determined by the Nature of Sale</h3>
            <p>
                Primary Sales
                <br>
                 MixDAO receives 100% of the total Sale Price for Primary Sales as executed by the terms of the Smart Contract.
                <br>
                Secondary Market Sales
                <br>
                MixDAO receives a 10% Royalty of total Sale Price for Secondary Market Sales paid by the Collector who sells the MixDAO Item, which is effectuated at the time of sale by the smart contract.
            </p>
            <h3>User Consent to automatic disbursement of fees and disbursements by the smart contract.</h3>
            <p>
                The User agrees and understands that all fees, commissions, and royalties are transferred, processed, or initiated directly through one or more of the Smart Contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network.  By transacting on the platform and by using the Smart Contracts, the User hereby acknowledges, consents to, and accepts all automated fees, commissions, and royalties for the sale of Items on the MixDAO Platform.  The User hereby consents to and agrees to be bound by the Smart Contracts’ execution and distribution of the fees, commissions, and royalties. Users hereby waive any entitlement to royalties, commissions, or fees paid to another by operation of the Smart Contracts.
            </p>
            <h3>User Consents to automatic disbursement of Royalties to MixDAO by operation of the smart contract on Secondary Sales.</h3>
            <p>
                The User consents to the automated collection and disbursement to MixDAO of royalties for Secondary Market sales of MixDAO Items. The User hereby waives any first sale defense or similar assertion with respect to Secondary Market activities resulting in a royalty to MixDAO.
            </p>
            <h3>Off Market transactions by User</h3>
            <p>
                MixDAO does not generally collect any fees, commissions, or royalties for transactions occurring outside of the MixDAO Platform and not involving the MixDAO Smart Contracts. The User is permitted to sell or transfer their MixDAO Items on third party exchanges; however, the User hereby waives any entitlement to royalties, commissions, or fees for off market transactions. The User irrevocably releases, acquits, and forever discharges MIX DAO LLC and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, and successors of any liability for royalties, fines, or fees not received by the User from any off-market transaction.
            </p>
            <h3>Gas</h3>
            <p>
                All User transactions on the MixDAO Platform, including without limitation Minting, tokenizing, purchasing, or confirming, are facilitated by Smart Contracts existing on the Ethereum network.  The Ethereum network requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network, and thus every transaction occurring on the MixDAO Platform.  The value of the Gas Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of MIX DAO LLC or the MixDAO Platform.  The User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract, agreement, offer, sale, bid, or other transaction on the Platform be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to a User. Users also acknowledge and agree that gas is non-refundable under all circumstances.
            </p>
            <h3>Taxes</h3>
            <p>
                Users are responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your use of the Platform (including, without limitation, any taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, purchase, or sale of any Works).
            </p>
            <h3>User acknowledgment of use of Smart Contracts to engage in transactions with MixDAO</h3>
            <p>
                To initiate a transaction on the MixDAO Platform, a User must voluntarily invoke one or more Smart Contract operations from an Ethereum Wallet. All transactions on the MixDAO Platform, including but not limited to transfers, listings, sales, or purchases of MixDAO Items are initiated though one or more Smart Contracts at the sole discretion and at the complete risk of the Users.  The Smart Contracts are configured to facilitate the execution of a voluntary User confirmation to purchase a MixDAO Item.  The User acknowledges the risk of Smart Contracts and agrees to be bound by the outcome of any Smart Contract operation by invoking, calling, requesting, or otherwise engaging with the Smart Contract, whether or not the Smart Contract behaves as the User expects.
            </p>
            <h3>User Acknowledges the Risk of Smart Contracts and Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>
                MixDAO Platform transactions, including but not limited to primary sales, secondary market sales, listings, and other operations through the Website utilize experimental smart contract and blockchain technology, including non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrencies, consensus algorithms, and decentralized or vendor-to-use networks and systems. Users acknowledge and agree that such technologies are experimental, speculative, and inherently risky. Users acknowledge and agree that the MixDAO smart contracts may be subject to bugs, malfunctions, timing errors, hacking and theft, or changes to the protocol rules of the Ethereum blockchain (i.e., “forks”), which can adversely affect the smart contracts and may expose you to a risk of total loss, forfeiture of your digital currency or MixDAO Items, or lost opportunities to buy or sell MixDAO Items. MixDAO assumes no liability or responsibility for any such smart contract or related failures, risks, or uncertainties.
            </p>
            <h3>Users Assume the Risk of Interacting with Smart Contracts</h3>
            <p>
                Users hereby acknowledge and assume the risk of initiating, interacting with, participating in Platform transactions and take full responsibility and liability for the outcome of any transaction they initiate, whether or not the smart contracts, the Website, or other Platform features behave as expected or intended. Users hereby represent that they are knowledgeable, experienced and sophisticated in using blockchain technology, the Website, and in initiating Ethereum-based transactions.
            </p>
            <h3>Users agree to refrain from hacking or interfering with smart contracts</h3>
            <p>
                Users are forbidden from engaging in any attack, hack, denial-of-service attack, interference, or exploit of any MixDAO smart contract. Operations performed by a User that are technically permitted by a MixDAO smart contract may nevertheless be a violation of our Terms of Service and the law.
            </p>
            <h3>MixDAO Makes No Representations or Warranties</h3>
            <p>
                MixDAO makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, written or oral, made by or on behalf of MixDAO in connection therewith, including any representations or warranties of title, non-infringement, functionality, merchantability, usage, security, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose or intended use, workmanship or technical quality of any MixDAO Item or work, smart contract code, or software.
            </p>
            <h3>MixDAO is Not Liable for the Outcome of Any Marketplace Transaction</h3>
            <p>
                MixDAO shall not be liable to you for contract, tort, or any other types of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of or related to participation in or the outcome of a Platform transaction, whether or not MixDAO has been advised or knew of the possibility of such damages. MixDAO liability for damages under this Agreement shall in all cases be limited to, and under no circumstances shall exceed, the amount of proceeds actually received by MixDAO arising out of the damage after deducting all costs, fees and liabilities incurred by or on behalf of MixDAO. 
            </p>
            <h3>MixDAO Reserves the Right to Modify these Terms and the Smart Contracts</h3>
            <p>
                MixDAO reserves, the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend, modify, alter or supplement these Terms and the smart contracts accessible through the Website from time to time.
            </p>
