                        MixDAO turned me onto Octohedz when they were struggling to mint out at .05.
                        They were 2 ETH floor, weeks later.

                        Probably the best part about this group is that almost every single member that contributes is passionate about a different sector.
                        I didn't realize how much of the NFT market I was missing!
                        I never would have minted NFT Worlds or even heard about it without Remix.
                        Also, a big perk, when WL became the go to method to distribute mints- I got all my early easy WL opportunities here.

                        It's so nice having a home base in this space, somewhere to get honest feedback and opinions without people trying to pump their own bags and exit off of you.

                        The best part about this community is that every person is contributing and willing to show you a different sector that you didn't know existed.
                        Bottom line, this is a pretty awesome home-base, and provides awesome alpha in the space.

                        I was lucky enough to have been invited to the MixDAO server early on.
                        Remix is very knowledgeable across cryptocurrencies and NFTs - and definitely one of the leading experts in this space.
                        Importantly, Remix has always been available to selflessly share his knowledge, 1:1 or in a group setting.
                        With the launch of his MixDAO server, he has developed a tight-knit and welcoming community of similar minded experts to come together to discuss and debate upcoming and existing NFT projects.
                        In the server, I have learned about so many NFT projects and it's guided my decision making process, both on the side of buying, as well as NFTs to avoid.
                        Remix is always open to suggestions from the community, as well, and constantly making improvements. 
                        The biggest alpha that was shared in the server was Bears Deluxe, where a few of the MixDAO community members discovered this project and amazing devs and shared with the community, weeks before the project was discovered in any meaningful way.

                        Remix's server not only helped me expose my project to the wider NFT community, they helped me understand the culture and ethics behind the space as well.
                        I couldn't recommend it more.

                        In MixDAO I learned a lot from reading what much more experienced people in the NFT space than myself were doing.
                        Everybody's friendly and real and it helped me a lot in developing my decision making when it comes to NFTs.
